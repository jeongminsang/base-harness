# Base Harness

Self-enforcing harness for AI-assisted development. The shared core owns rules, memory, skills, debate state, and verification gates. Each AI coding assistant (Claude, OpenCode, OMX, Codex) gets a thin adapter layer.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18
- Git repository

## Install

```bash
# Remote
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeongminsang/base-harness/main/bootstrap.sh | bash

# Local
bash bootstrap.sh
```

The installer keeps `bootstrap.sh` as the single entrypoint and lets you install `claude`, `codex`, `opencode`, `omx`, or `all`.

## Quickstart

### Claude / OpenCode (OMO) / OMX

1. Install with the `claude`, `opencode`, `omx`, or `all` adapter option.
2. Open the AI coding assistant in the repo.
3. The assistant reads `.claude/settings.json`, `.opencode/settings.json`, or `.omx/settings.json` and runs the shared hook pipeline automatically.

### Codex

1. Install with the `codex` or `both` adapter option.
2. Before substantial work, run:
   ```bash
   ./.codex/commands/preflight.sh "task summary"
   ```
3. After substantial edits, run:
   ```bash
   ./.codex/commands/post-task.sh
   ```
4. After verification, record the verified files and run the final gate:
   ```bash
   ./.codex/commands/mark-verified.sh src/example.ts src/example.test.ts
   ./.codex/commands/final-check.sh
   ```

## Canonical Verification State

The canonical success marker is `state/verified-complete.json`.

During migration, the harness still accepts the legacy `.omc/state/verified_complete.json` file if it already exists, but new installs and new verifier writes should use `state/verified-complete.json`.

## Update

Re-run `bootstrap.sh`. It is safe for update mode:

- Existing `.claude/settings.json`, `.opencode/settings.json`, `.omx/settings.json` files keep non-hook settings and get only the hook section refreshed.
- Existing `AGENTS.md` files prompt before regeneration.
- Re-running Codex install refreshes `.codex/commands/*` deterministically.
